# Gunt Crusher

Hello!
So Gunt Crusher is supposed to be a website that shows cool places around a location of your choice, and draws a route from your location to the hotspot of your choice based on certain criteria that you setup.

The idea behind it is that I really wanted get into the habit of running and getting helthier, but I find the act of running to be a bit boring without a destination and a clear path. So I thought of building a website that can show me all the cool places around me, and help me sketch out a running path from the location of my choice to those hotspots around me.
Now sure thare are apps that already sketch out a running path for you, and others that introduces you to awesome spots around certain locations; But I couldn't find one that motivate enought to get out on that run and push myself to do better cardio. So I am going to try to build one myself.

Now so far there aren't many functionalities available. I am using the fusion yelp api and the openstreetmaps api to showcase a map and fetch and display locations, but I am still having trouble with showing all the locations and sorting them based on different filtering options.
What I am planning to implement next is to ensure that I add more sorting options, and introudce the pathfinding between two markers on the map after I figure out how to use routing with osm or how to use some other open source service..

Other than that you can try the janky version of the website on this link: https://guntcrusher.onrender.com/

And Please feel free to suggest any changes, fixes, or functionalities that you can think of.

I appreciate you taking the time to check this out! Have a blessed day and enjoy UFC 303 tmr!
